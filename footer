			<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
			<p>I threw an anonymous site together in 2004 as sort of a repository of raw notes, stories, ideas and pictures.  I kept my name off the site so that I could really let loose and say anything I wanted.</p>
			<p>Four years later I realized that:</p>
			<p> <span class="alt">A)</span> I didn't have anything that needed to be anonymous. <br/><span class="alt">B)</span>  Few people stumbled upon the site.<br/> <span class="alt">C)</span>  Most who did promptly left.<br/> <span class="alt">D)</span> The whole thing was damn ugly and difficult to navigate.</p>
			<p>It was time for a change.</p>
			<p>I took out the trash, spit shined the leftovers and did my best to turn it into a typical, self-serving, narcissistic, personal shrine to myself.  Don't you just love it?</p>
			<p>If so, be sure to hit the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page and let me know what you think.  Feel free to tell me how neat I am and how amazing and life changing you found my website.  No, really, do it.  Now.</p>
			<p> Please? Seriously. Maybe we can like meet up and hang out or something. I like lunch. In fact, I eat lunch almost every day.  What's that? You eat lunch, too? See, we have so much in common. I knew we'd be pals! I'm so glad you <a href="contact.html">contacted</a> me via my website.</p>
