### The 924SE

In 1987 Porsche released a 924S option package to the European market
called the LeMans Edition. The idea was to produce a lightweight car
with an adjustable suspension suitable for weekends at the track. In
1988 they released it to the US as the 924SE. 500 were produced. All had
black exteriors with a lightweight grey/maroon cloth interior, manual
windows, staggered 16" phone dial rims, adjustable height struts with
koni inserts, larger sway bars, mud flaps, and optional sunroof.

I got an itch to do some DE events with a 924S. I figured if I was going
to buy one, I might as well find something that is somewhat unique and
rare. So, I went on a 4 month search to find an '88 924SE with no
sunroof that was good enough to use as a daily driver and for the
occasional DE's held at Gateway.

### My 1988 Porsche 924SE - "Baby Rat"

-   Named after the song "Lindsay Lohan's Revenge" by Pace Rock and MC
    Spank Rock.
-   Purchased November 25, 2008 from the Louisville Craigslist for
    \$2200.
-   The guy did not know it was an SE. I did not tell him. He had the
    right answer for every question I asked. The car sounded like it was
    in decent shape.
-   I did not go see the car before I bought it. My father-in-law drove
    down with a trailer to bring it home. He called me when he arrived
    and said, "It'll be a good car if you want a project."
-   He dropped it off in my driveway that night. I spent a week crying
    about how I paid \$2200 for a \$500 car. It is so crappy it can't be
    anything but a dedicated track car.
-   Currently gutted and running ok with a new engine. Needs more parts
    to be safe enough for a track day.

### A Complete 924SE

There is a lot of confusion about what distinguishes a real 924SE. I
found a trashed, but complete one about an hour and a half south of my
house. I went down to have a look. I would have bought it, but I don't
have the room and my experiences with the above car put a nasty taste in
my mouth… (insert some joke about a nasty baby rat.) Here are some
photos of the correct interior, mud flaps and wider rear rims on a real
924SE:
