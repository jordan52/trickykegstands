 Running/driving 1984, GMC, Rally Sport, full sized van with approx 120k
miles. Besides the new transmission, the van is in horrible shape.
 Good for:

-   Moving band equipment
-   Rehabbing a house (it is amazing how much drywall and bags of
    concrete you can cram in there)
-   Hauling trash
-   Permanent residence down by River des Peres
-   Putting your neighbors in a fit of "28 Days" rage.

Not so good for:

-   The environment (8 MPG, leaks fluids like an octogenarian)
-   First dates

I bought it to take the band on short tours. We named it Biggie because
the trailer's name was Tupac. More recently, the van has been used to
help buddies move, haul trash, launch a pontoon boat, and annoy my
neighbors.
 I am completely serious about getting rid of it because the plates
expire Jan 31. Therefore, any offers or clever disposal methods will be
duly considered.
 For your convenience, I have attached pictures of the van up close and
as seen from space.
