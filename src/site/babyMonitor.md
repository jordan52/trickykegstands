### Baby Monitor

Your friends used to be cool, but now they have a baby. It is your duty
to spice up their day.

(by reading this you agree to the disclaimer found at the bottom)

Go to their house Saturday afternoon to visit the baby. While you're
there take note of the baby monitor's brand and frequency.

Run to babies-r-us after the visit and pick up the same monitor. Open it
up carefully (you'll be returning it on Sunday.) You only need the
baby's side.

On your way to the bars that night stop by their house. Just go ahead
and walk in the backyard with the baby monitor you just bought. Get as
close to their bedroom as possible.

Turn it on. You'll get a signal.

Whisper directly into the baby monitor's mic...

***"I'm in your house"***

repeat until you see every light in the house flip on. Leave before the
police show up.

disclaimer - DO NOT EVER DO THIS. EVER... TO ANYONE. If you do and
someone or something gets shot/hurt/maimed/brusied or damaged in any way
(even a hang nail) it is not my responsibility. Thank you, please pull
through.
