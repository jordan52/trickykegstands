The Best Trip Ever
------------------

Dad said, "Jordan, we're going on vacation next week."

I said, "Really? Where?"

"Out West. Two weeks"

"We're driving the Orange Gremlin out West?"

"Yes."

This is where I'm going to slowly try to piece the trip back together.
Now that I look back, we saw some crazy shit. It was pretty rad.

corn palace, 603 N Main St, Mitchell, SD (on 90 west of sioux falls.)

wall drug, 510 Main St, Wall, SD

mount rushmore, south dakota -south of sturgis so we maybe hit that
first?

crazy horse (8 miles from mt. rushmore between Custer and Hill City)

sturgis, south dakota, DURING BIKE WEEK! This was before it got super
popular.

badlands, south dakota (south east of sturgis)

a ride in some dudes rickety helicopter near/over the badlands, south
dakota

black hills SD

homestake gold mine near Lead, South Dakota, closed in 2002. directions:
From Interstate 90 Take Hwy 85 (Exit 17) south off I-90 towards
Deadwood. Once you reach Deadwood, Hwy 85 turns into Hwy 14A. Stay on
Hwy 14A through Deadwood - it will take you straight to Lead, SD. Once
in Lead, you will take a left at the first stop light. Stay on this road
- it will take you down Historic Main Street.

I lost my swatch watch in spearfish wyoming at a diner

devils tower, wyoming off hwy 90

yellowstone, way west of cody wyoming. slept in the car

south, maybe hit idaho, i remember salt lake city, eventually hit hwy 15
thru utah. The battery boiled over, so he just didn't turn the car off
until we could find a new one. We continued onto the

grand canyon, AZ north rim, then south rim

drove thru colorado so we probaly went back up 15 to 70 east home.
