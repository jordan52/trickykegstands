### Breakfast With Daisy

Daisy (the weenur dog) and I were watching the Histroy Channel and
having some breakfast this morning. Some show about fighter jets and
famous dog fights was on. I love that shit. At one point, the narrator
said, "Modern weapon systems can move from missles to guns with a flip
of a switch."

Daisy looks at me and says, "Yeah, I've been in a lot of dog fights.
Check this out."

She jumps off the couch, trots to the middle of the room and clears her
throat.

"GOOSE! I'm switching to my GUNS!"

She flexes her tiny little biceps and starts bobbing and weaving around
the living room like a cracked out Mike Tyson.
