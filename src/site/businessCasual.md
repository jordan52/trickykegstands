### Business Casual

Our office is finally moving to the new building. Sure, i'm moving from
offices to a cube farm, but that cube farm doesn't smell like ass and it
has windows with a view of the park... WINDOWS!!! I can't wait to get
out of this cave.

They decided to implement a "business casual, M-F, no exceptions" rule
in the new space. Not a big deal but it got me thinking about just how
much I hate business casual.

Before now, i had nothing to say about Biz Caz besides, "No sir, I
didn't like it." Much like that horse on ren and stimpy I no
explaination. Just didn't like it.

It hit me yesterday. I finally figured out what irks me so much about
having to wear tucked in polo shirts and brown belts. By definition,
**you cannot rock business casual**. You just can't. If you do, it's no
longer business casual.

Looks like I'll be dusting off my ties. I know how to rock one of those.
