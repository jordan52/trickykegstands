Hi, I'm Daisy. My sister\*, Sofeeuh, is dumb and has a tiny little
bladder. We'll be in the middle of a conversation and she'll just squat,
mid sentence, and do her thing right on the carpet. Heck, if she was
Native American, she would be sofeeuh-pees-on-floor. She poops tooâ€¦ but,
I eat that.

Our people started putting her in a cage during the day. I'm all like,
what-ev-er\*\*, the cage has got to go!

I want to trade the cage for Greenies or chicken sticks... Cash is
useless. I'd immediately lose it on party poker.

I have no pictures of the cage, but here is a recent picture of us.
Sopeeuh is the tard with the tongue. Remember, this is a trade for the
cage, not for us!

 \* - no relation. \
 \*\* I'd make a "W" with my paws or snap, but it's hard w/o thumbs \

-   no -- it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other
    commercial interests\
