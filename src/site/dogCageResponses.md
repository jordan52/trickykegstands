I don't have any cages or anything, but I just wanted to say, damn
you're funny. Thanks for brightening the day.

I just wanted to tell you how cute your doggies are, I have one of my
own. This is my dog and his brother just in case you cared to see them.

Greenies are known for killing dogs cause they do not digest. I would
never give them to my dog.

YOUR FUNNY!

So what is it that you want to trade? Guess I don't understand. By the
way, we had a little dachcie and had the same problem with the peeing
and pooping. They are a handful at time
