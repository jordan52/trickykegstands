### Evil Hornet

This is the only car I've ever completely lost control of.. the worst
was right there at [ellendale and
picadilly](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=ellendale+ave+and+picadilly+ave&ll=38.603465,-90.314387&spn=0.002859,0.007532&t=h&hl=en)
funny thing is, i never wrecked it. Thank god.. it's probably the most
unsafe car I've ever driven.\

Get it? All sixes? Evil Hornet? Am I like totally SO clever or what?
