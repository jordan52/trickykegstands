### Forty-Five Second Theories

Give a monkey a brain and he'll think he... This section is kind of like
that. I like to think something through for about 45 seconds and write
it down like I came up with some groundbreaking idea. I cut it off after
45 seconds because most of these are developed while punching out an
email. Also, if I think about it for any more than that and I'll find
holes and/or google it only to see that someone already had thought of
this or some archaeologist found scratched it onto a cave wall
somewhere. I think it's more fun to pretend i'm all smart and shit.
