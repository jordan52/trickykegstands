### The Gremlin

I bought a Gremlin for my dad on Fathers day 2003. It had been in
storage for 7 years when I bought it... Jay was nice enough to help me
get it started, drive it home, and clean it up before we gave it to him.

 The gas tank was (and still is) full of crraaap so we had to rig a 1
gallon gas can and duct tape it in the engine compartment. That picture
is one of the many stops on the way home to re-fill the gas can...
Safety first!\
