### I Quit Drinking for a Week

And I feel fucking great.

I've never been much of a drinker. If I had to guess, I'd say I average
4 or 5 beers a week and a puking binge about 4 times a year (see
[Drunk](drunk.html)). Last week I went to an event where I normally
would have gotten shitty... For reasons that are not entirely obvious to
me, I thought, "I'm not going to drink tonight."

So... I didn't. I remember everything about the evening and I felt
flipping great in the morning. I'm a little sad that I wasn't able to
make an ass out of myself, but I got a lot done the next day... Anyway,
since that night, I've had 2 sips of champaign and 1 swallow of really
really really good merlot.

I don't know if the lack of alcohol has anything to do with me feeling
completely fucking amazing, but I feel fucking great. So, i thought i'd
share.

that's all i got.
