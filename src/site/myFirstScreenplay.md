#### FADE IN:

In a small bedroom with the sun peeking delicately through dark drapes,
two figures are visible on the bed. Embraced and a little sweaty, their
bronzed skin and chiseled bodies contrast sharply with the plain, off
white bedroom. A room where we're not surprised to see the clock blinks
12:00.

Her long, thin thigh peeks through a split in the sheets. With dark
brown hair and pouted cinnamon lips she gazes into her lover's eyes. He
speaks:

#### Stephano

I couldn't help but notice your left nipple is a little hairy while your
right is perfectly smooth. Isn't that interesting?


 

#### Aubrey

That's what happens when you walk in on me before I'm finished plucking.
You need to learn how to knock first.


 

Faintly in the distance, a dog barks.
