### My Rig

is awesome.

(circa 2004)

Now I have an extra TSL JCM2000, a mesa 2x12, a preamp handmade by obed
khan, and a jekyl and hyde overdrive/distortion pedal (I bought a pedal!
crazy, no?) I sold the mesa amps in the photo above. I don't miss them
that much.

#### I really want

![](media/jordanPedal.jpg)

I managed to get a broken Jordan wah pedal for cheap on ebay. The
electronics seem pretty wasted and I can't find a schematic anywhere.
The mechanical parts are fine, though. If I can't fix it I'll convert it
to a passive volume pedal.
