### Off the Junk

#### last time:

leading up to it

-   week of preparation - buying decaf coffee, telling everyone, saying
    goodbye to the cafe
-   fight with SO over lack of empathy or support.

the big day

-   ceremonial end of the coffee
-   at work, pain couldn't do anything.

after

-   replaced the coffee with beer and advil.
-   continued to drink decaf everything.
-   told everyone i quit coffee. bragged about it.
-   fell off that wagon in 10 days.

#### this time:

-   no preparation... bad yogurt... sick as hell for 3 days, lost 7
    lbs..
-   the headache was amazingly awful, but I couldn't do anything anyway,
    so no big deal.
-   managed to convince myself the ChocolatelySummerTymes were gross.
-   day 6, still doing nothing... nap at work.
-   day 7, feel weird but really really good. no nap. jokes are funnier.
-   day 8, feel really really good, not so weird. no nap.
-   day 9, same.
-   day 10, relaxed and alert. i can still tell a difference. i mean, it
    is still a novelty.
-   i only told one person.. can't even remember who it was.
-   i still have coffee in the fridge.

the difference?

-   traffic isn't as annoying. road rage is gone.
-   the little things don't freak me out.. like getting my plates
    renewed and paying bills. no big deal.
-   i can sit and watch tv with the dogs.
-   less pacing.
-   i'm more clumsy.
-   i am not obsessing over whimsical ideas quite as much.
-   productivity? exactly the same.
-   crazy dreams are back.
-   better at ignoring the passing time when trying to complete a
    difficult task.
-   i am guessing the next coffee I drink will make me wired as hell and
    that is good. I'm going to save it until i need it.

#### 50 days later

Don't feel weird at all anymore. The only negative is getting out of bed
in the morning is really rough and I now like naps. (I used to hate
naps.) One perk is I am now able to sleep till 10am with no problem. I
missed being able to do that.. now i can.

I still have crazy dreams, so that's fun. I don't seem to be as clumsy.
My obsessions over whimsical ideas are back. Oh, and I am still very
relaxed. it is nice!

In the end, this whole thing is not nearly as exciting as I had hoped.

#### 90 days later

Eh... Still don't drink coffee and haven't really wanted any. The rough
mornings, clumsiness and extra naps were due to an ear infection... once
I got that cleared up getting up early was all good. However, I can
still sleep till noon and the dreams are crazy fun. My final verdict is
not \_having\_ to have coffee in the morning is very convenient but not
nearly as exciting as the time [I quit drinking for a
week](iQuitDrinkingForAWeek.html)
