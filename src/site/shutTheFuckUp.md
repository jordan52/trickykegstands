### Shut the Fuck Up

Sometimes it is best to simply shut the fuck up. Sadly, I realized this
while watching the finale to the bachelor. (I do not have control of the
remote... ever, which is fine beacause [I Hate Tv](iHateTv.html).)

Anyway, the girl got the shaft and was upset. Who could blame her. After
the big let down they filmed her in the limo. The poor thing was going
on and on and on about how she was the best and he made the worst
mistake and how she is so much better than the other girl... yadda yadda
yadda... She immediately lost all class and turned into a bumbling
moron. I shouted at the TV (cause I am a retard and because I felt sorry
for her) Please! before you make yourself look any worse... SHUT THE
FUCK UP!

Chris Rock said it best when he said, "Shut the Fuck Up."

My mom once said, "You have to watch out for those quiet girls. Some of
them are dumb and don't have a lot going on up there. But, \_some\_ of
them are brilliant. Always thinking. Working it out. Those are the ones
you have to watch out for. They're fun but they'll get you in a lot of
trouble.

I like to think of myself as a pretty quiet guy. Not because I don't
have anything to say... I have a lot to say. I've just learned that in
most situations it is best to SHUT THE FUCK UP. Kind of lame, but that's
what I do.
