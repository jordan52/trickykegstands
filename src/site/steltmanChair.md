### Steltman Chair - Sorta...

This is what happens when you put me in a room with 2 2x4's and a saw.

I saw the Steltman Chair at SLAM a few months... err.. make that
probably years ago and thought, "I love that!" Anyway, band practice got
canceled at the last minute so I put on some gloves and started sawing.
I didn't have any drawings and I couldn't remember its name so this is
all from memory.

I found a picture of the original online today. I'm surprised at how
close I got.

By the way, the original artist's name is Garrit Thomas Rietveld. His
chair is badarse:

Apparently, I hacked together the left-handed version.

By the way, this chair is for saleâ€¦ It isn't very sturdy so I'll take
\$25 for it.
