### The Inventor

A worn man walked in and ordered a Gentleman Jack. He dropped something
heavy on the bar (I jumped because it freaked me out) and sat on the
stool next to me. It looked like some sort of muffler clamp with a
threaded rod and a piece of angle iron welded to it.

"You know what that is, boy?"

I put my drink down. "No."

"Thats more money than you'll ever see in your life, son."

"It looks more like a muffler clamp to me."

"This is NOT(!) a muffler clamp." He picked it up and twirled it on his
fat finger. "This is a muffler clamp... *WITH ADAPTER*. I invented it."

He put it on the bar and continued. "Any chump can make a muffler clamp,
son. My muffler clamp has this adapter." He petted it like a hamster.
"That's what makes it special. I got me a patent on it. Look it up -
'Muffler Clamp with Adapter.'"

"I thought you just told me it was money."

"I sold it to AutoZone for two-hundred-thousand dollars today. Let's
drink some whiskey."
