### The Inventor - Drink 2

"Young man?" He slapped me on the back. "You ever have a pretty girl?"

I put my drink down. "I've got one right now."

"You're real lucky. I had one. A real pretty girl. Sang like an angel,
that one. She'd tell me about being a kid and how they'd sing harmony.
Her and her sisters. They'd sing in the car, at the bus stop, and every
single night while they washed dishes. That must have been a sight. Them
standing there? Probably the most beautiful thing in the world. They
were tall. All three of them, all with this straight brown hair. Long.
Beautiful."

"Oh yeah? What happened?"

He lit his cigarette, took a long drag, looked me in the eye and got
real quiet.

"Don't trust a girl who doesn't eat pancakes."
