### The Inventor - Drink 6

"You know what I hate?"

I put my drink down, "Hondas?"

"What the?" He spit an ice cube into his glass. "What kind of a weirdo
do you take me for, boy?" He put his glass down. "A Honda? That's a
good, reliable car. Nobody in their right mind hates a Honda."

"Sorry. What do you hate?"

"I hate the guy on the bus who's reading a book." He picked up his
drink. "No, let me clarify that point. I hate the guy on the bus who's
got the book he's reading up in the air and angled just so." He crouched
down in a riding on the bus and reading a book position. "He's got that
book way up high so everyone can see the cover."

"Oh yeah?"

"Yeah. The asshole this morning had his neck all twisted and cocked just
so he could yell to the bus, 'Look at me! I'm reading a goddammed
romance novel.'" He stood slowly and held onto the bar. "You can't judge
a book by its cover, but you sure as hell can judge a man by his book's
cover."
