### Jeep

I used to drive a '95 jeep wrangler rio grande named Herman… It had
these awful gold spoke rims but was hella fun in the snow.

If you look real close at this satellite image, you can see a tan top
and a green hood on a car in a parking lot.. that's the jeep:

I only know that because I was screwing around on MS's terra server and
noticed the images were timestamped… i checked the date on the satellite
images in my area and compared them to my archived email which gave me a
good idea where I was. It was a work day - I parked in the same spot
pretty much every day. So, there's Herman.
