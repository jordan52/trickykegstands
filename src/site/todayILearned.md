### Today I Learned

If your csv file starts with the string, "ID," Excel thinks it should be a SYLK file and barfs a bunch of warning 
dialogs <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/323626>

I'm setting aside my hatred for funk and fusion so I can learn about [The Meters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meters) 
today. They're a 70's funk band from New Orleans. I get it, I think. There was a 5 minute bass solo which included
a minute of wha wha and a few moments where he ignored the rest of the band (it is a polyrhythm! applaud goddammit!)

If you're sad that wasn't a video of baby pandas, here is a bucket of sloths <http://vimeo.com/59234110>	

I've been working on a thought experiment where I derive paths to get $1.5M\*. Or, rather, what 
exactly does it take to create $1.5M in value. Take t-shirt sales, for example. 
(I'm making these numbers up. I'm sure they're naive. Try not to get hung up on them.) Say you make 
$1.30 profit on each shirt sold. Assuming a 30% tax rate, you'd have to sell 1.5 million shirts. 
How can you sell that many shirts? It will take herculean combination of marketing and luck no doubt, 
but what about manufacturing and distribution? What kind of support would you need (server capacity, 
call center, physical warehouse, employees) What kind of pains are bound to happen at that sort of 
scale? What are your quantifiable risks?

Sure, it is silly but it takes me way outside my comfort zone. That has got to be good, right?. 
In the future I'm going to apply that sort of framework to the ideas I think of or get pitched. A sad 
part of it is applying it to most of my ideas lead to the whole, "You'll make more money opening a 
couple of Dunkin' Donuts and it will be way easier." conclusion. **I call it "The Dunkin' Donuts Test" &#174;** 

Maybe I should write a self-help how to book based on the Dunkin' Donuts Test. Could that book net me 
$1.5M? How long would it take to write the book? What does it take to market a $1.5M book? What are the risks 
involved? Take an objective look at existing book sales, publishing figures and the number of starving 
authors out there... What's the back of the envelope conclusion? It would be eaiser and less risky to open 
a few Dunkin' Donuts...

And why Dunkin' Donuts? My grandfather was a baker so it is in my blood. Sadly, I can't bake so I'd need
sort of a turnkey franchise to set everything up and I'd need to hire people who can deal with mixers and
whatever it takes to make food. **done**

The first thread on this HN post <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3816350> which is about Gabe's argument
for a single co-founder is a nice conversation about diversifying with several, small, monthly income type
projects.

The Show is the Rainbow is now [Touch People](https://soundcloud.com/touch_people) and apparently he is a 
big gamer.

\* - this is what I consider the lowest rung of f-you money. Enough to retire on some rocky land in the
Ozarks and not do anything except maybe learn to hunt.

Before this morning the only [Deer Tick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Tick_(band)) I've heard is off 
Divine Providence (they're latest album.) 
Hearing some things off [War Elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Elephant_(album)) is a surprise. They're folk-alt-country? I had no idea. I'm 
sure the recent change to their sound was a deliberate move, but I like to think that through the 
years they've been accidentally writing these one-off songs that didn't at all fit with their sound. 
Then one day they were like, "let's finally record all these fuckers and put them on one album."

Last night in the State of the Union address Obama said, "Today, our scientists are mapping the human 
brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s." I work on the platform that handles imaging data for the 
Human Connectome Project and all that FDA stuff I bitch about is for a new class of Alzheimer's drug. 
Our lab is managing the brain imaging data. Fun!

I have no problem with [The Show is the Rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Show_is_the_Rainbow).

Little else going on today. This FDA BS is getting me down. But, band practice is in a bit so that'll
make it all better.

She walked slowly though her gait was one of a barback sliding quickly through the crowd with buckets of
ice. Her walk is best described as some sort of reverse moonwalk in high heels.

Practice was better this week. I was more with it than last week. The two new songs are coming along 
nicely. Best joke of the night was Frank Ocean was simply channeling the spirit of Wesley Willis Sunday
night at the Grammy's.

Speaking of jokes, here's a doozie I made up while brushing my teeth, "Of course i'm jealous of
her ex's. They can dodge bullets." This, my friends, is why I'm often confused for a comedy genius.\*

\* - not true.

Frank Ocean is a little rough around the edges when it comes to Grammy performances. I should have
watched. Instead I was working.

I still love We Were Promised Jetpacks and then a Counting Crows song came on and I thought, "oh 
you..." and then i listened to it and then i realized that there is always room for these effusive
songwriters like Dashboard Confessional and now, who, Mumford and Sons? What are they really doing?
Playing the game. And then 15 minutes later I realize I'm still listening to Counting Crows.

Oh, and yeah, so a lot of the stuff I've been listening to relies heavily on rich reverbs
and echo (braids, givers, seryn, tree ring) so that's sort of the sound now. And then some old pearl
jam or this counting crows stuff comes up which relies heavily on multitap delays. Was multitap
delay sort of the sound of the late 90's? I know I was using the hell out of it (even though I had
no idea what I was doing and it sounded like crap)

Friday the sys admins were losing their shit. Today it is the developers who are doing a live demo in
ten minutes. I'm glad it isn't me.

Google API's are a tease. I know they can do what I want them to do but google imposes artificial
limits that stop me just before I get a solution. I can't blame them, of course.

"Foodfight" is a terrible movie I want to see: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROQ9nplxIY>

**Move along, nothing to see here:** If you can give 
society what it wants you have a higher likelihood of being "successful." If
you can, move forward using a process of productive adaptation (assuming you can observe the 
landscape as you trudge through it and all of its inevitable setbacks) in an effort to "evolve"
your process in cooperation with the general path of the system's nature. Don't let your self
interests be in conflict with the system because you won't succeed. Nature is testing you and it is
not sympathetic. You need to step back and design a machine of the right people doing the right
things. Constantly assess and improve that machine by objectively comparing outcomes with goals. If the 
outcomes are inconsistent with your goals, modify the machine. Include yourself as part of the
machine and place yourself in the correct role. If you aren't good at that particular role, be
sure to fire yourself. Again, the most important requirement is you are objective and logical at
all times. **done**

I used that trick to install elastisearch today. (these really are just my notes so I don't forget.) 
./bin/elasticsearch to start it up. It is running on port 9200. Then I wrote an app to index a ton of 
json. hit http://localhost:9200/cases/case/_search Then I installed elasticsearch-head using these 
instructions <https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head> use it by hitting http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/

Elasticsearch might replace solr in our environment. However, i think elasticsearch's documentation
is god awful.

I'm oddly excited about using Quickbooks. I spent two hours with an accountant this morning
and it sort of changed my life (not really.) I wonder what else I could learn by hanging out
with someone I normally wouldn't. For example, what could I learn in 2 hours with a tow truck 
driver? How about 2 hours with a funeral director, or, I don't know, an arborist? 

I hang out with a gardener from time
to time and you know what? It is fascinating. One time he was showing me a book (he's a reader)
and I opened it up and some sort of pressed leaf fell out and he was like, "Wow,
let me have a look at that... Oh, yes, that's from a blah-blah-blah(latin) which is a rare 
species of blah blah (more latin) typically found in (exotic location.) I was somewhere in 
Clayton when I saw it. I was so excited I took a leaf." 

And holy shit, FDA documentation is a drag but the power keeps going out and the admin
guys are running around losing their minds. Today also includes lots of chocolate milk and there is
a surprise party tonight. It is a good day.

Here's the deal. If you're on a team and trying to do documentation don't use Word. Make a
simple rule: Everyone writes everything in markdown and everything is committed to 
bitbucket or github. This goes for specs, documentation, whatever. If you need some sort of
fancy font or table, provide a stylesheet or embed some html. Doing this solves a sundry
of problems. (I wanted to say "sundried list of problems" but i don't know if sundried
is a form of the adjective sundry and it looks like sun dried as in tomatoes. which are
fan frikin' tastic by the way.) You get your versioning under control, you don't have to
worry about losing anything and you never have to deal with Word destroying your formatting.

Fuck MS Word. Excel? Excel is fine. Powerpoint? Ppt is annoying (use markdown if you can.)

The only beef I have with markdown is I can't ever decide how to deal with word wrapping.
I do carriage returns manually right now instead of using an editor that wraps for me. Doing that is
painful when editing, and i edit a lot (I know, doesn't seem like it, right?) Maybe I have
two beefs, but not with markdown per se. My
editor is an IDE which barely has spell check. My mac doesn't have spell, So, well, until
I do a site-wide spell check this whole thing is going to be riddled with typos. yay.

My toynabee tile has not survived the winter.

this <http://selectadecision.info/> is kind of fun.

I pulled this next thing out of my checklist doc (private) because it doesn't belong 
there. It belongs here:

Things to remember:

*  Kanban Board <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board>
*  Watch "The 400 Blows" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_400_Blows>
*  This guy is a good photog <http://mrelllis.tumblr.com/>
*  This is a good forum thread <http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/topic/33420-style-inspiration/page__st__2310>
*  Learn more about superfuture.com

The superfuture thing comes from something I read on /r/malefashionadvice regarding a boot choice
and the fact that yes, someone could pull it off, but "you'd have to be so ridiculously on point
you probably wouldn't be on MFA in the first place" and then someone mentioned superfuture and I 
went there and kind of get it but not really.

I'm running on empty.

If you're close to using all of your RAM, quit screwing around. Go out and buy some more!

Pudenda... is it a real word? I'm at work so I can't look it up.

I can't get the hearbeat task to run in my app. 

Today I am... chatty. 

Creating documentation for FDA regulated trials is a drag.

How many people out there get some level of enjoyment out of making a joke that is either so
meta or obscure that everyone listening thinks you are serious? This is one of my favorite
things. Along those lines, sometimes I am bitter about growing up with a comically gifted 
set of friends. Here's why. When someone makes an average joke and everyone sort of chuckles 
I kind of want to smash their face with bricks. The joke was painfully obvious and there were
a dozen other things they could have said that would have been funnier.

Of course, I typically keep quiet because I know most of my jokes aren't that good.

I should purchase parts at a discount site and take them with me when I take a car in for repair. I
paid $84 for a rubber boot today. Never again.

I don't write very well anymore.

It is impossible for me to fake my way through band practice with this new band. There aren't enough
of us in the band to cover mistakes. I like that.

Centralize logging (see Graylog2) is the shit. I never gave much thought to logs in the past but now
that there is a way to search/filter and view all logs from all apps and servers from one dashboard, 
I want to use them for everything. I will spend the next few days making my log messages work for me.
First thing is sort of a heartbeat that does a system check and spits it to a log. I'll be able to
filter for those heartbeat messages to assess the status of my apps realtime (and historically if I
need to track down an issue.)

Warby Parker!

The Chippewa boots are really nice! I busted out my vintage, made in England Doc Martens and cleaned
them up. Now I have 2 pairs of boots. The docs are also very nice. I had no idea how good I had it
back then. I've worn nothing but crap shoes for the past 10 years and, well, now I know the error of
my ways. Also, wool socks are phenomenal. I used to only wear them snowboarding like they were only
for special occasions. I asked for a few pairs for Christmas and have been wearing them ever since.
Amazing!

Boot Decision 2013!  I wanted Wolverine 1000 Mile boots, but they were $340. Then I wanted Red Wing
Iron Rangers, but they were $285. I bought Chippewa Apache Lacer's for $136.

Miami Connection - <http://youtu.be/VpZu69OB2KM>

I moved configuration (passwords and tokens and whatnots) out of the webapp properties so I wouldn't
accidentally push them to a repo. I wasn't sure the best way to do this, though. I explored using
jasypt, but it seemed like overkill, and its development isn't very active. I wound up putting
everything into /etc/\<project\>/\<project\>.properties on each server. I figure the server knows
its own environment so it can be responsible for providing the correct settings in that properties
file. I did not encrypt because 1) Each of my servers is typically responsible for one thing and 2)
if someone has access to that file on one of my servers, i have big problems anyway. Sure, I should
encrypt sensitive data there, but I'm saving that for a rainy day.
