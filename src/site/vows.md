### Wedding Vows

I have some promises I'd like to make to you.

I promise to be with you, through sadness and beauty, whispering funny
thoughts, giving hope and joy, infusing our relationship with light and
exhilaration, and showing my love through words, thoughts and touch.

I promise to need you, not to fill some emptiness, but to feel a
fullness and wholesome serenity, forever sharing moments and silence,
gliding smoothly forward with inspiration and love.

I promise to love you, the best that I know how. And when our last
delicate dance comes to an end, I'll hold you until the applause rings
still, knowing we lived it well.

These promises I give to you, forever.
