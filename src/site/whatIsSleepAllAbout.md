### What Is Sleep All About?

*an email sent to someone one day*

Oh, and here's my "I thought about it for 45 seconds and formed a solid
theory" theory about why we need sleep:

Our brains use up a LOT of energy compared to the rest of our bodies.
Just like anything else, when energy (i.e. food) is scarce it is
necessary to conserve as much as possible. It's even dumber to waste a
resource when it is scarce... costs too much.

It's tough to hunt/gather food at night. Hell, it's tough to do
anything. It gets cold out (bodies have to reallocate energy use just to
maintain body temp) and you can't see anything. It just makes sense to
shut down the thing that uses the most energy for the time it can't be
used to do the thing it was designed for.
