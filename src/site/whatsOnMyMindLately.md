##### 5 Second Theory - Free Will?

(I'll move it [here](fortyFiveSecondTheories.html) when I get a chance
to think about it for another 40 seconds)

â€‹1) Your consciousness is delayed by n seconds because it needs more
time to process. 2) Your brain tricks you into feeling like you're
running real-time. 3) The systems in your body that do run real-time
define the majority of your being.

Some people might call these real-time systems your subconscious. I
define the subconscious as various reactive systems that quickly
calculate probabilities based on external stimuli and does their best to
perform the most likely correct reaction.

I like to think of "life" as our awareness which, in this case, means
consciousness.

This means life is more like a choose-your-own-adventure. Your automatic
systems kind of go on doing their thing and when your conscious catches
up it gives some input on what to do next.

##### 3 Second Theory - Why We Sleep (more of a fun what-if cause it has got a lot of holes)

(I'll move it [here](fortyFiveSecondTheories.html) when I get a chance
to think about it for another 42 seconds)

This is fun. What if our consciousness can't keep up with life? That is,
what if our consciousness runs at, say, 2/3's the speed of what is
happening in the outside world? If that's the case, sleep (or
unconsciousness) is what happens while our mind is catching up and
processing what has happened during the previous day. Hear me out for a
minute while I try to explain.

To make things simple, let's say everyone wakes up at 8am and goes to
sleep at midnight, every day. That means we're awake for 16 hours and
asleep for 8.

If you have a Tivo, this might make sense. Let's say you are addicted to
a daily soap opera that has 16 hour long episodes... This show is
action-packed and too complicated to comprehend. Your best friend said,
"Hey, I watched it on slow motion and it made so much more sense. You
should try it." So, you do. The show starts at 8am and you're there for
the opening credits. When it starts you immediately hit the "slow"
button to get it to run at 2/3's speed.

BAM! The show makes so much more sense now that you can catch every
detail. Thank god our Tivo has an 8 hour buffer. As you watch you're
filling up that buffer.

At midnight, the show ends. But, you're watching on slow-motion. You're
only two-thirds of the way through. Thank god your Tivo has an 8 hour
buffer. You won't miss a single detail.

Work with me here... The soap opera is off the air from midnight to 8am.
Let's say it is asleep. You and your tivo, though, are busy chugging
along that whole time trying to process what happened. You're processing
the bufffer.

At 7:59am the next day you're finally at the end of the previous day's
soap. You close your eyes, take a deep breath and open them again. The
clock strikes 8am and the soap opera begins again.

I am trying to say that the person sitting there watching the tivo is
your mind. The soap opera is life. Those 8 hours when our bodies are
laying still and we are unconscious is just the time when the soap opera
is off the air. There is a person in your head with a 8 hour buffer tivo
living your life. We don't need sleep to process. We need sleep to catch
up.
