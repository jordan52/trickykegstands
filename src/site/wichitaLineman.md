### Wichita Lineman

I had a lot of fun recording [Big Red](bigRed.html) and I have some
friends who think Glen Campbell's 1968 hit, *Wichita Lineman* is the
greatest song of all time:

 Did you notice his [Fender Bass VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Bass_VI)? I want one REAL bad. 
 
 Anyway, I spent 2 hours on a cold Sunday evening making them a
surprise. It's pretty awful, but it got a couple laughs so I say,
success!
